# Board-Game-Project

Project Description:  This project is designed to display different insights about boardgames by using a collection of ranked data from boardgamegeek.  The collection and cleaning process for the files are included and use both r and python.  The final result is a shiny app that displays board game description wordclouds, various graphs, and insights, as well as a custom board game search feature.

Process:  Users will need to open the 'Board Game Scraper.py' file to collect the data.  This is not an automated process, and users may need to check to make sure that they have gathered the complete set of data that they're after.  
	After this, open up the 'Boardgames.R' file and run through the lines of code to clean the file.  Once finsished, the generated csv file can be used to run the R shiny app.  Make sure that for both R files and the python file that you change the locations of the directories where the files are being saved.
